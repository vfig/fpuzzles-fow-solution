# F-Puzzles Fog of War Bulb & Solution
Userscript to add a fog of war bulb control and solve-mode fog to f-puzzles. Bulb cosmetics and correct digits will lift the fog of war in adjacent cells. The fog will be activated as soon as a solution is set.

Credits:
- Solution userscript is by [dclamage](https://gist.github.com/dclamage/63cc6241752dbeb1214328f4ae655cf7), modified by [killroy42](https://gist.github.com/killroy42/7c86b25da1c76f7173c51714c2bd615f). My version here adds copy/paste.
- Lightbulb userscript is by [yusitnikov](https://github.com/yusitnikov/fpuzzles-fow-bulb). My version here changes the bulb to a cosmetic, so it does not conflict with e.g. even/odd constraints.
